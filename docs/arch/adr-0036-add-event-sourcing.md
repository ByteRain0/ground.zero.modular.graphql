Ideas to enhance the solution with:

Events (most of them are unfortunately CRUD based...) :
An idea is to make a user interaction module/api that uses event sourcing.
- anime/manga/author/studio/rating:created
- anime/manga/author/studio/rating:deleted
- anime/manga/author/studio/rating:updated
- anime:watched
- manga:read
- rating:submitted
- rating:popularity-changed (track best rated animes / genres (UI/data composition issue))
- Leaderboards:
Show rankings such as "Top Rated Animes of the Month" or "Most Read Mangas This Week."
Update rankings dynamically using events like AverageRatingUpdated and RatingAdded.
-


Ideas:
Audit Logs: Maintain a complete history of changes to your entities (e.g., when an anime changes studio or a manga changes authors).
Analytics: Build projections to analyze trends, like "Most productive authors" or "Genres with the most animes over time."
Build a browsed history to track user anime preferences based on genres of anime he often watches.

Behavioral Scenarios
Anime-Author Relationships:

Event: AuthorUpdated (change name).
Reaction: Update projections (read models) for all related anime/manga to reflect the new author name.
Studio-Anime Relationships:

Event: AnimeCreated or AnimeDeleted.
Reaction: Update the list of animes associated with a studio in projections.
Popularity Tracking:

Event: AnimeUpdated (genre changed).
Reaction: Adjust projections tracking genre-based popularity.
Fan Interaction (Future Feature):

Add events like AnimeFavorited or MangaReviewed to track user interactions.

New Functional Behaviors
Real-Time Analytics:

Generate leaderboards for top-rated animes/mangas.
Show trending entities based on recent ratings.

Use rating data to suggest similar highly-rated animes/mangas to users.
Implement collaborative filtering for personalized recommendations.
User Activity:

Track user rating history with events like RatingAdded or RatingUpdated.
Send notifications like "You've rated 10 animes this month!"
Community Metrics:

Calculate and display community-wide metrics (e.g., most-rated genres, average rating by studio/author).
Fraud Detection:

Trigger RatingSuspiciousActivityDetected if a single user or group inflates ratings for an entity abnormally.
Payload: { entityId, anomalyType, details, timestamp }
